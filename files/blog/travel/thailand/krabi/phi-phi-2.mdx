<h3>Phi Phi Leh: The Beautiful Island</h3>
<p>
Phi Phi Leh is known for its amazing Maya Bay (which is currently closed to help nature recover). Visitors love this island because nothing has been built on it. It has tall cliffs of rock, clear blue lagoons like Pileh Lagoon, and the mysterious Viking Cave, where people used to collect bird nests to eat. You can visit Phi Phi Leh on a boat trip for the day.

<h3>Bamboo Island: A Tropical Paradise</h3>
<p>
Bamboo Island (also called Koh Mai Phai) is close to Phi Phi Don. It's a small island with soft, white sand and colorful coral reefs all around it. It's a perfect place to spend the day snorkeling, swimming, and enjoying the sunshine.

<h3>See the View: Phi Phi Viewpoint</h3>

If you want to see the whole island of Phi Phi Don, climb to the Phi Phi Viewpoint. The hike is a little hard, but the view is worth it! You'll see both of the island's bays and its beautiful green forests.
