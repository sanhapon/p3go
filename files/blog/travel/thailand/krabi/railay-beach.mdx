Imagine soft, white sand, towering limestone cliffs, and water so clear you can see colorful fish swimming around you. That's the magic of Railay Beach on the Krabi coast of Thailand.  Railay is a little different from other beaches because it's on a peninsula only reached by boat, giving it a secluded and special feeling.

<h3>Getting to Paradise</h3>
<p>
Railay Beach is a boat trip away from either Krabi Town or Ao Nang Beach. Boats leave regularly throughout the day and the journey takes about 15-20 minutes.  You can buy tickets at the pier and hop right on one of the traditional longtail boats. Once you arrive, you'll feel like you've stepped into another world.
