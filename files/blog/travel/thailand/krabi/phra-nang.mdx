<h3>A Legendary Tale: The Enchantment of Phra Nang</h3>
<p>
Phra Nang Beach is steeped in a captivating legend. Local stories tell of a princess named Phra Nang, who tragically died at sea during a storm. Her spirit is said to reside within a cave at the beach, and the towering limestone cliffs surrounding the cove are believed to be her guardians, turned to stone. Fishermen visiting the beach would leave offerings to appease the princess, and even today, you might see colorful symbols placed at the cave's entrance â€“ a symbol of fertility associated with the legend.

<b>Interesting Fact</b>: The beach was previously called Railay West Beach, but its name was changed to Phra Nang Beach in the 1980s due to the popularity of the legend.
