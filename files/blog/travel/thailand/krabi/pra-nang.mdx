According to local folklore, Pra Nang was the wife of a fisherman who set out to sea and never returned. Distraught and heartbroken, Pra Nang waited patiently for her husband's return, spending her days at the cave overlooking the sea. She was said to possess supernatural powers and was revered by local fishermen, who would make offerings to her in hopes of receiving protection and bountiful catches.

Over time, Pra Nang became deified as a goddess of the sea, fertility, and prosperity. Fishermen would visit the cave to seek her blessings before embarking on their fishing expeditions, leaving behind offerings such as flowers, incense, and intricately carved wooden phalluses, which symbolize fertility and virility.

The cave itself is adorned with numerous phallic-shaped stalactites and stalagmites, which are believed to be manifestations of Pra Nang's divine presence. Locals also tell tales of encountering Pra Nang's spirit within the cave, manifesting as a beautiful maiden surrounded by an ethereal glow.
